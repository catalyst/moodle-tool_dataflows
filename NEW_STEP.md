# Creating a new step type

This section will summarise the actions involved in creating a new step type and useful APIs you can use. This is mainly described in a checklist fashion.

<!-- #### Before creating the step -->
<!-- - [ ] Check to ensure the step type you want doesn't already exist. -->
<!-- - [ ] Next, consider if the step type belongs in the core dataflows plugin, or belongs in a separate plugin. -->

#### Creating the step class

Each new step type requires at least the following:
- [ ] Config fields `form_define_fields` - lists all the fields used as configuration and their properties
- [ ] Validation `validate_config` - called to validate the configuration stored, and on fail prevents the dataflow from running
- [ ] Execution method `execute` - the heart of the step. This performs the action of the step.
- [ ] Custom form inputs method `form_add_custom_inputs` - allows you to define and customise the configuration UI as Moodle form inputs (with tooltips and help text).
- [ ] Unit tests - e.g. demonstrating what it should be able to do.
- [ ] Relevant lang strings added in `lang/en/tool_dataflows.php`

#### Wiring together the action in `execute()`

Several convenience methods have been added to make this process a bit easier. You have:

- `$this->get_config()` which returns the configuration of the step, as an **object**, with all the expressions already evaluated.
- `$this->is_dry_run()` which returns whether the dataflow was executed under dry run mode.
- `$this->log()` which allows you to log a message during execution which if run directly would print the message to the user.
- `$this->set_variables()` which is useful when your step gets some new data which you want to make available in other steps.

For the general gist of how things are structured, please look at the existing examples:
- [connector_wait step](./classes/local/step/connector_wait.php)
- [connector_curl step](./classes/local/step/connector_curl.php)

There are some differences between flow, reader and connector steps that may need to be taken into account.
